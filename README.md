# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis
A data analysis project comparing casual and member usage trends for Cyclistic Bike-Share to develop marketing insights.

**Objective**

This project analyzes Cyclistic's bike-share data of the year 2020 to identify differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. The findings aim to inform marketing strategies for converting casual riders into annual members.

**Overview**

Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, offers single-ride, full-day, and annual membership plans. While casual riders (single-ride and full-day users) form a significant customer base, annual members are more profitable. The marketing team seeks data-driven insights to design campaigns encouraging casual riders to purchase annual memberships.

Key Questions Addressed
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

This analysis focuses on the first question.
